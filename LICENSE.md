This README provides a clear guide on installation, running tests, and understanding the CI build setup. The CI build is configured to run on Node.js versions 16.x and 18.x, and it includes steps for installing dependencies, running tests with coverage, and integrating with Coveralls for code coverage reporting.

Make sure to adjust the information in the README to match your project's specific details.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or if there's anything else I can do for you.
